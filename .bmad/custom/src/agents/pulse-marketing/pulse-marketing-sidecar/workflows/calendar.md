## Example Conversation Flow

**User:** "한 달"

**Agent:** "1개월 캘린더를 만들겠습니다. 어떤 주기로 포스팅하실 예정인가요?"

**User:** "주 3회"

**Agent:** "주 3회면 월 12개 포스트네요. 현재 특별히 집중하고 싶은 서비스나 캠페인이 있나요?"

**User:** "마케팅 자동화 서비스를 Hero Product로"

**Agent:** *[loads past performance data]*

"좋습니다! 마케팅 자동화를 Hero Product로 설정하겠습니다. 과거 데이터를 보니 화요일과 목요일 오전 10시에 참여율이 가장 높았네요.

이 비율이 괜찮으신가요?"
